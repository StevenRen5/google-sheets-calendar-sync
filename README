# Google Sheets to Calendar Sync

This Google Apps Script connects a Google Sheet to your Google Calendar.  
Each row in your sheet becomes a calendar event — and updates or deletes sync automatically.

## Features
- Creates events from spreadsheet rows  
- Updates existing events when editing rows
- Deletes events if the rows' title, start, and due date are empty
- Adds a custom "Calendar Sync" menu to your sheet to easily sync sheet and calendar

## Setup
1. [Click here to make a copy of the sample Google Sheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1TEmMz2DskQQlrbTtEbCvzEcu7-wZIPb0U5qm7jcKqBo/copy) 
  This will copy both the spreadsheet and the attached Apps Script.
2. OPTIONAL: After copying, go to **Extensions → Apps Script** to review the code.  
3. Return to the sheet and refresh the page.  
4. You’ll see a new **“Calendar Sync”** menu at the top — use it to sync events with your Google Calendar.

**Note:** Be sure to read the comments below the data table in the sheet.
